        <li>The url to our github repo that is available to both us and the
            professor: <a
                href="https://github.com/343-F24-Shrestha/343f24final-playlist_maker">https://github.com/343-F24-Shrestha/343f24final-playlist_maker</a>
        </li>
        <li>The url to our deployed application: <a
                href="https://343-f24-shrestha.github.io/343f24final-playlist_maker/">https://343-f24-shrestha.github.io/343f24final-playlist_maker/</a>
        </li>
        <li>As for a part of the requirements we were unable to finish in time for this milestone was the
            media queries for the webpages. We plan to implement this so our webpages display properly on different
            screen sizes.
        </li>
        <li>We plan on using the Spotify API that allows for developers to retrieve data about songs, playlists, etc.
            Another API we could use would be Last.fm that
            also provides its services for developers.
